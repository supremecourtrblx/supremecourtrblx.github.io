# State of the Judiciary Messages

At the opening of each congressional term, the Chief Justice is required by law to deliver a message on the state of the judiciary (Judiciary Act of 2025, div. A, tit. I, §108). The message analyzes and communicates the administrative needs and concerns of the federal judiciary.
