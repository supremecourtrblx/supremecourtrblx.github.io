# Orders of the Court
The vast majority of cases filed in the Supreme Court are disposed of summarily by unsigned orders. Such an order will, for example, deny a petition for certiorari without comment. Lists of orders do not have set dates for publication since they can be issued at any time, but do appear on the Court's calendar when scheduled. "Miscellaneous" orders may be issued in individual cases at any time.
