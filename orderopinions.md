# Opinions Relating to Orders
Opinions may be written by Justices to comment on the summary disposition of cases by orders, e.g., if a Justice wants to dissent from the denial of certiorari or concur in that denial. Any opinions written during October Term 2024 (October 1, 2024, through September 30, 2025), will be posted here on the day they are issued.
