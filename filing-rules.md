# Electronic Filing
The electronic filing form below is an ongoing pilot program of the Supreme Court. Filers should have no problem with filing through the form. But if docketing takes over 12 hours or a problem occurs, filers should then re-file in the e-filing channel of the [Judiciary discord server](https://discord.gg/r36JgmYTdB).

Filers have both choices to either submit through the form below or through the e-filing channel or the [Judiciary discord server](https://discord.gg/r36JgmYTdB).

# Rules and Guidance

The Supreme Court has not promulgated permanent rules. Litigants should seek to real life Supreme Court rules as reference.
