# ELECTRONIC FILING PILOT PROGRAM

The Supreme Court is implementing a new pilot program in which filers can submit documents directly through the Supreme Court's website. This will primarily ease the processing of files for the Court compared to the e-filing channel of the Judiciary discord. The pilot program will start today until an indefenite period of time until the Court can fully determine which filing system to utilize.

Filers have both choices to either submit through the form below or through the e-filing channel or the [Judiciary discord server](https://discord.gg/r36JgmYTdB). Filers should have no problem with filing through the form. But if docketing takes over 12 hours or a problem occurs, filers should then re-file in the e-filing channel of the Judiciary discord server.

You can find the electronic filing form on the [filing and rules page](/filing-rules.html) or the [Supreme Court's trello](https://trello.com/b/XME7IgoF/usa-supreme-court).
